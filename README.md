</p>

A small, opinionated Laravel package that locks accounts after repeated failed login attempts. It provides both in-memory throttling (cache counters) and optional persistent locks stored in the database, plus unlock notifications via a temporary signed link.

---

## Quick Start (Usage)

These steps get you from install to a working lockout flow in your app.

1. Install with Composer:

```bash
composer require beliven-it/laravel-lockout
```

2. Publish configuration and migration stubs:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lockout-config"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lockout-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

3. Add the trait to your authentication model (e.g. `App\Models\User`) and implement the `LockableModel` contract:

```php
use Beliven\Lockout\Traits\HasLockout;
use Beliven\Lockout\Contracts\LockableModel;

class User extends Authenticatable implements LockableModel
{
    use HasLockout;
}
```

4. Protect your login route with the middleware:

```php
use Beliven\Lockout\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsNotLocked;

Route::post('/login', [LoginController::class, 'login'])
    ->middleware(EnsureUserIsNotLocked::class);
```

The package also expose an additional middleware for ensure that locked users cannot access to any routes:

```php
use Beliven\Lockout\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserCannotAccessWhenLocked;

Route::middleware([EnsureUserCannotAccessWhenLocked::class])->group(function () {
    // protected routes for authenticated users
});
```

5. Scheduler (recommended)
- The package includes a console command `lockout:prune` to remove old records according to the retention values in `config('lockout.prune')` (`prune.lockout_logs_days` and `prune.model_lockouts_days`). In production you should schedule this command to run regularly via Laravel's scheduler (and ensure your cron runs `schedule:run`).

Example: register scheduled tasks in `routes/console.php`

```php
<?php
//....
// routes/console.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('lockout:prune --force')->dailyAt('02:00')->withoutOverlapping();

// Optional: separate schedules for logs/models, or different cadences.
Schedule::command('lockout:prune --only-logs --force')->dailyAt('03:00')->withoutOverlapping();
Schedule::command('lockout:prune --only-model --force')->weekly()->withoutOverlapping();

```


Tips
- You can override the retention periods at runtime by passing `--days-logs` and/or `--days-models` to the command, e.g. `php artisan lockout:prune --days-logs=30 --days-models=180 --force`.
- Ensure `lockout.prune.enabled` in your config is `true` (default) for the scheduled prune to actually perform deletions.

6. Test manually:

- Attempt failing logins for the same identifier until the threshold is reached.
- Inspect the `lockout_logs` table and (if configured) `model_lockouts` for persistent locks.
- If `unlock_via_notification` is enabled, the package will try to send a temporary signed unlock link to a notifiable model.

---

## Configuration (summary)

Full options are in `config/lockout.php`. Here are the most important settings and their defaults:

```php
return [
    'login_field' => 'email',
    'unlock_via_notification' => true,
    'notification_class' => \Beliven\Lockout\Notifications\AccountLocked::class,
    'notification_channels' => ['mail'],
    'lock_on_login' => false,
    'login_notification_class' => \Beliven\Lockout\Notifications\AccountLogged::class,
    'lock_link_minutes' => 1440,
    'max_attempts' => 5,
    'decay_minutes' => 30,
    'cache_store' => 'database',
    'auto_unlock_hours' => 0,
    'unlock_redirect_route' => 'login',
    'unlock_link_minutes' => 1440,
    'logout_on_login' => false,
    'prune' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'lockout_logs_days' => 90,
        'model_lockouts_days' => 365,
    ],
];
```

Recommendation:
- Use a durable cache (Redis or database) in production for counters (`cache_store`) so counters persist across processes and restarts.

---

## Unlock route & controller

The package generates signed unlock links using the route name `lockout.unlock`. 

If you publish the package routes or want to register the route yourself, ensure a route with that name exists and points to the unlock controller:

```php
use Beliven\Lockout\Http\Controllers\UnlockController;

Route::get('/lockout/unlock', UnlockController::class)->name('lockout.unlock');
```

The unlock link is temporary and validates the signature before performing the unlock action. The link lifetime is configurable via the `lockout.unlock_link_minutes` configuration key (default: 1440 minutes, i.e. 24 hours).

--

## Logout on Login

If you want to ensure that when a locked user attempts to log in, any existing sessions are terminated, you can enable the `logout_on_login` configuration option. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to prevent locked users from maintaining active sessions.

It is also useful in scenarios such as third-party admin panels (e.g. Filament, Nova) where you can't easily add the lockout middleware to the login route.

You can enable this feature by setting the `logout_on_login` option to `true` in your `config/lockout.php` file:

```php
'logout_on_login' => true,
```

You can also override the `logoutOnLockout` method on your model that uses the `HasLockout` trait to customize the logout behavior further. The default behavior is:

```php
public function logoutOnLockout(?string $guard = null): bool
{
    // Default common case behavior
    // (to be overridden in concrete models if needed)
    Auth::guard($guard)->logout();
    session()->invalidate();
    session()->regenerateToken();

    return true;
}
```

## Lock on Login

This package optionally supports a "lock on login" flow that lets a user lock their own account immediately after a successful sign-in via a one-click, signed link sent to their email.

How it works
- When `lock_on_login` is enabled in the configuration, the package's `OnUserLogin` listener will attempt to send a login notification to the authenticating model after a successful login.
- The notification contains a temporary, signed URL (route name `lockout.lock`) that, when clicked, will immediately create a persistent lock for that account.
- The route that handles the link (`LockController`) will:
  1. Resolve the login model for the supplied identifier.
  2. Create a persistent lock for the model (via `lockModel` / the model's `lock()` helper).
  3. Optionally send an unlock notification (if `unlock_via_notification` is enabled).
  4. Redirect the user back to a configured route with a friendly status message.

Enable the feature
```php
// config/lockout.php
'lock_on_login' => true,
```

Important notes
- The authenticatable model must be notifiable (i.e., implement `notify()` / use the `Notifiable` trait) for the package to send the login notification.
- The notification class used for the login notification is configurable via `lockout.login_notification_class`. By default the package ships `\Beliven\Lockout\Notifications\AccountLogged`.
- The temporary signed lock URL lifetime is controlled by `lockout.lock_link_minutes` (default 1440 minutes).
- The lock route is protected by Laravel's `signed` middleware — the request must be a valid signed URL.

Example route (the package registers this for you if you include package routes):
```php
Route::middleware(['signed'])->get('/lockout/lock', \Beliven\Lockout\Http\Controllers\LockController::class)->name('lockout.lock');
```

Translation & notification text
- The `AccountLogged` notification uses translation keys under `lockout.notifications.account_logged.*`. You can change the notification class or customize translations to alter the subject / body of the email sent at login.

Security considerations
- Because the lock link grants the ability to immediately lock an account, the link is temporary and signed; ensure `APP_KEY` and your app URL are configured correctly so signature validation works reliably.
- The link includes a random entropy parameter to reduce predictability.

Customizing behavior
- Replace the login notification by setting `lockout.login_notification_class` in your config.
- If you want a custom flow when the link is clicked, you can override the `LockController` or register your own route/listener for `lockout.lock` and `lockout.unlock` events.

This feature is opt-in; leave `lock_on_login` disabled if you prefer not to send login notifications.

## API Reference (quick)

Use the `Lockout` facade or the `Beliven\Lockout\Lockout` service from the container.

- `Lockout::getAttempts(string $id): int` — return attempts count for identifier
- `Lockout::incrementAttempts(string $id): void` — increment attempts counter
- `Lockout::hasTooManyAttempts(string $id): bool` — whether attempts >= threshold
- `Lockout::attemptLockout(string $id, object $data): bool` — increment, create log, dispatch EntityLocked when threshold reached; returns whether locked after call
- `Lockout::attemptSendLockoutNotification(string $id, object $data): void` — send the unlock notification if enabled & model is notifiable
- `Lockout::getLoginField(): string`
- `Lockout::getLoginModelClass(): string`
- `Lockout::getLoginModel(string $identifier): ?Model` — tries to resolve a model from configured provider
- `Lockout::lockModel(Model $model, array $options = []): ?ModelLockout` — create persistent lock via relation
- `Lockout::unlockModel(Model $model, array $options = []): ?ModelLockout` — mark lock as unlocked, clear attempts, dispatch EntityUnlocked
- `Lockout::clearAttempts(string $id): void` — clear cached counter

These helpers are also used internally by the `HasLockout` trait; your models can call `$model->lock()` and `$model->unlock()` which delegate to the service.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- Replace notification class: set `lockout.notification_class` to your own class implementing the same constructor signature (identifier, duration, url).
- Change notification channels: set `lockout.notification_channels` to e.g. `['mail', 'database']`.
- Replace or extend listeners: bind your own listeners for `EntityLocked` / `EntityUnlocked` in your `EventServiceProvider`.
- Replace login model resolver: set `auth.providers.users.model` to change how the package resolves a model for an identifier.

Example: custom notification class in `config/lockout.php`:
```php
'notification_class' => App\Notifications\MyAccountLocked::class,
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- Notifications not sent:
  - Ensure `unlock_via_notification` is `true`.
  - The resolved model must implement `notify()` (use `Notifiable` trait).
  - Verify your mail driver and config (MAIL_* env vars).
- Counters not behaving:
  - Check `cache_store` config; if using `array` store counters reset on each request-run. Use `redis` or `database` in production.
- Signed unlock links failing:
  - Ensure your app URL / APP_KEY is set and consistent.
  - Check the route name `lockout.unlock` and that the route is reachable.
- Coverage / testing:
  - To generate coverage locally you need Xdebug or phpdbg enabled. Example:
    - With Xdebug: `php -d xdebug.mode=coverage vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-text`
    - With phpdbg: `phpdbg -qrr vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-text`
  - On CI use a matrix image with Xdebug enabled.

---

## Developing (run tests, coverage & local development)

If you're working on the package itself locally:

1. Install dev dependencies:
```bash
composer install --dev
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
vendor/bin/pest
```

3. Generate coverage (requires Xdebug or phpdbg):
```bash
# Xdebug
php -d xdebug.mode=coverage vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-text --coverage-clover=coverage.xml

# phpdbg
phpdbg -qrr vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-text --coverage-clover=coverage.xml
```

4. Useful notes:
- Use `config()->set(...)` in tests to override settings (examples in tests).
- Database migrations for tests are in the test bootstrap; if adding schema changes, update migration stubs and test setup.
- To run a single test file with Pest:
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/SomeTest.php
```

## Events & Examples

- `EntityLocked` — fired when threshold is reached. Default listener may create a persistent lock and/or send notification.
- `EntityUnlocked` — fired when a persistent lock is cleared. Useful to log unlocks or notify admins.

Example listener registration is done via your `EventServiceProvider` if you need to override defaults.

### Example. Prevent login on filament

// todo

### Example: Laravel Nova Action

If you use Laravel Nova, you can expose an Action that lets administrators unlock a user directly from the Nova resource. The Action can resolve the model and call the trait helper `$model->unlock(...)`, which delegates to the package service.

Example Nova Action (concise):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Nova\Actions;

use Laravel\Nova\Actions\Action;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\ActionFields;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class UnlockUser extends Action implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;

    public function name()
    {
        return 'Unlock account';
    }

    /**
     * Handle the action for the given models.
     *
     * @param  \Laravel\Nova\Fields\ActionFields  $fields
     * @param  \Illuminate\Support\Collection  $models
     */
    public function handle(ActionFields $fields, $models)
    {
        foreach ($models as $model) {
            // call the HasLockout trait helper which delegates to the Lockout service
            // you can pass optional metadata like reason/actor/requestData
            $model->unlock([
                'reason' => 'Unlocked by admin via Nova',
                'actor'  => auth()->user()?->id ?? null,
            ]);
        }

        return Action::message('Selected accounts have been unlocked.');
    }

    public function fields()
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

Add the action to your Nova Resource (e.g. `User` resource):

```php
// in app/Nova/User.php

public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        new \App\Nova\Actions\UnlockUser,
    ];
}
```

Notes:
- The Nova Action calls the model method `unlock()` directly; the trait delegates to the package service so the unlock behaviour (clearing attempts, dispatching events) remains consistent.
- If you need to customize the service used by the trait, you can override `resolveLockoutService()` on your model (see Customization & Extensibility).
